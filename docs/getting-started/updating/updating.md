Before you setup your Minimal Phone, you should always update it to the latest version of the software to ensure you have the latest improvements and security updates!

## Updating

5. If the screen shows, "Installation paused", you can force it to resume and update ASAP, otherwise it'll update when you're not using the device.

## Troubleshooting

If your update fails with `Installation Failed`, check your connection, try restarting your device and try again.

If you see `Can't check for update`, check your connection, try restarting your device and try again. If this is a replacement device, contact support.
